# react-random-color-generator

Design and develop a random color generator web application using React. 
This application will show a random color when a button is clicked:

- A button with the exact text Generate will cause a new color to be generated when it is clicked

- Once a color is generated, update the background color of a div which contains the exact text Generated Color: <background color hex code> (the background color and the hex code must match)
